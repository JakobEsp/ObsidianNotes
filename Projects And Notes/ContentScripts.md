How to build a story video:
	
	intro
		Keep short and engaging 2-4 sentences
		prove credebility
		no swear words
		30~ seconds long
		
	Sections
		expocition
		rising action
		climax
		resolution
	
	outro
		keep intro 1-3 seconds long
		only plug stuff like sub
		send viewer to another video


Notes:
Keep language personal & human
Use transition language
	keep sections seemless
if content is too short teach more instead of just adding words
Ask questions and come back to them later
